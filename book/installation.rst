Installing and Configuring Symfony
==================================

安装与配置 Symfony
==================================

这章节的目标是让你起步并运行建立在Symfony上的应用程序。幸运的是，Symfony提供“分布”， 它是具有功能性的Symfony起步项目，你可以立刻下载它和开始开发。

The goal of this chapter is to get you up and running with a working application
built on top of Symfony. Fortunately, Symfony offers "distributions", which
are functional Symfony "starter" projects that you can download and begin
developing in immediately.

Installing a Symfony Distribution
---------------------------------

安装Symfony分布
---------------------------------

.. tip::

    首先， 检查你是否安装和配置了PHP Web服务器（譬如Apache）。更多关于Symfony需求信息，
    查看:doc:`requirements reference </reference/requirements>`。

    First, check that you have installed and configured a Web server (such
    as Apache) with PHP. For more information on Symfony requirements, see the
    :doc:`requirements reference </reference/requirements>`.

Symfony打包“分布”，它是一个全功能的应用程序，包含Symfony核心库，一套有用的Bundles，一个
合理的目录结构和一些默认配置。当你下载一份Symfony分布时，你在下载一个功能性应用程序骨架，它
可以立刻使用于开发你的应用程序。

Symfony packages "distributions", which are fully-functional applications
that include the Symfony core libraries, a selection of useful bundles, a
sensible directory structure and some default configuration. When you download
a Symfony distribution, you're downloading a functional application skeleton
that can be used immediately to begin developing your application.


通过开始访问Symfony `http://symfony.com/download`_ 下载页面。
在此页，你可以看到 *Symfony标准版本*，这是一个主Symfony分布。 这里有两种方法开始你的项目：
Start by visiting the Symfony download page at `http://symfony.com/download`_.
On this page, you'll see the *Symfony Standard Edition*, which is the main
Symfony distribution. There are 2 ways to get your project started:

Option 1) Composer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

选择 1） Composer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Composer`_ 是为PHP打造的关联管理库，你可以用它来现在Symfony标准版本。

`Composer`_ is a dependency management library for PHP, which you can use
to download the Symfony Standard Edition.

开始 `下载 Composer`_ 到你本机。如果你已经安装了Curl，那么就如此简单：

Start by `downloading Composer`_ anywhere onto your local computer. If you
have curl installed, it's as easy as:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

.. note::

    如果你的计算机无法使用Composer，那么你查看一些推荐，当运行这个命令的时候。 
    按照推荐安装 Composer 至正常可用。

    If your computer is not ready to use Composer, you'll see some recommendations
    when running this command. Follow those recommendations to get Composer
    working properly.

Composer是一个PHAR执行文件， 你使用它可以下载标准分布。

Composer is an executable PHAR file, which you can use to download the Standard
Distribution:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php composer.phar create-project symfony/framework-standard-edition /path/to/webroot/Symfony '~2.6'

.. tip::

    为了能够更快的下载第三方文件， 可以在Composer命令后添加 ``--prefer-dist`` 选项。

    To download the vendor files faster, add the ``--prefer-dist`` option at
    the end of any Composer command.

.. tip::

    Add the ``-vvv`` flag to see everything that Composer is doing - this is
    especially useful on a slow connection where it may seem that nothing is
    happening.

This command may take several minutes to run as Composer downloads the Standard
Distribution along with all of the vendor libraries that it needs. When it finishes,
you should have a directory that looks something like this:

.. code-block:: text

    path/to/webroot/ <- your web server directory (sometimes named htdocs or public)
        Symfony/ <- the new directory
            app/
                cache/
                config/
                logs/
            src/
                ...
            vendor/
                ...
            web/
                app.php
                ...

Option 2) Download an Archive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also download an archive of the Standard Edition. Here, you'll
need to make two choices:

* Download either a ``.tgz`` or ``.zip`` archive - both are equivalent, download
  whatever you're more comfortable using;

* Download the distribution with or without vendors. If you're planning on
  using more third-party libraries or bundles and managing them via Composer,
  you should probably download "without vendors".

Download one of the archives somewhere under your local web server's root
directory and unpack it. From a UNIX command line, this can be done with
one of the following commands (replacing ``###`` with your actual filename):

.. code-block:: bash

    # for .tgz file
    $ tar zxvf Symfony_Standard_Vendors_2.6.###.tgz

    # for a .zip file
    $ unzip Symfony_Standard_Vendors_2.6.###.zip

If you've downloaded "without vendors", you'll definitely need to read the
next section.

.. note::

    You can easily override the default directory structure. See
    :doc:`/cookbook/configuration/override_dir_structure` for more
    information.

All public files and the front controller that handles incoming requests in
a Symfony application live in the ``Symfony/web/`` directory. So, assuming
you unpacked the archive into your web server's or virtual host's document root,
your application's URLs will start with ``http://localhost/Symfony/web/``.

.. note::

    The following examples assume you don't touch the document root settings
    so all URLs start with ``http://localhost/Symfony/web/``

.. _installation-updating-vendors:

Updating Vendors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At this point, you've downloaded a fully-functional Symfony project in which
you'll start to develop your own application. A Symfony project depends on
a number of external libraries. These are downloaded into the ``vendor/`` directory
of your project via a library called `Composer`_.

Depending on how you downloaded Symfony, you may or may not need to update
your vendors right now. But, updating your vendors is always safe, and guarantees
that you have all the vendor libraries you need.

Step 1: Get `Composer`_ (The great new PHP packaging system)

.. code-block:: bash

    $ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Make sure you download ``composer.phar`` in the same folder where
the ``composer.json`` file is located (this is your Symfony project
root by default).

Step 2: Install vendors

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php composer.phar install

This command downloads all of the necessary vendor libraries - including
Symfony itself - into the ``vendor/`` directory.

.. note::

    If you don't have ``curl`` installed, you can also just download the ``installer``
    file manually at http://getcomposer.org/installer. Place this file into your
    project and then run:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ php installer
        $ php composer.phar install

.. tip::

    When running ``php composer.phar install`` or ``php composer.phar update``,
    Composer will execute post install/update commands to clear the cache
    and install assets. By default, the assets will be copied into your ``web``
    directory.

    Instead of copying your Symfony assets, you can create symlinks if
    your operating system supports it. To create symlinks, add an entry
    in the ``extra`` node of your composer.json file with the key
    ``symfony-assets-install`` and the value ``symlink``:

    .. code-block:: json

        "extra": {
            "symfony-app-dir": "app",
            "symfony-web-dir": "web",
            "symfony-assets-install": "symlink"
        }

    When passing ``relative`` instead of ``symlink`` to symfony-assets-install,
    the command will generate relative symlinks.

Configuration and Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At this point, all of the needed third-party libraries now live in the ``vendor/``
directory. You also have a default application setup in ``app/`` and some
sample code inside the ``src/`` directory.

Symfony comes with a visual server configuration tester to help make sure
your Web server and PHP are configured to use Symfony. Use the following URL
to check your configuration:

.. code-block:: text

    http://localhost/config.php

If there are any issues, correct them now before moving on.

.. _book-installation-permissions:

.. sidebar:: Setting up Permissions

    One common issue is that the ``app/cache`` and ``app/logs`` directories
    must be writable both by the web server and the command line user. On
    a UNIX system, if your web server user is different from your command
    line user, you can run the following commands just once in your project
    to ensure that permissions will be setup properly.

    **1. Using ACL on a system that supports chmod +a**

    Many systems allow you to use the ``chmod +a`` command. Try this first,
    and if you get an error - try the next method. This uses a command to
    try to determine your web server user and set it as ``HTTPDUSER``:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ rm -rf app/cache/*
        $ rm -rf app/logs/*

        $ HTTPDUSER=`ps aux | grep -E '[a]pache|[h]ttpd|[_]www|[w]ww-data|[n]ginx' | grep -v root | head -1 | cut -d\  -f1`
        $ sudo chmod +a "$HTTPDUSER allow delete,write,append,file_inherit,directory_inherit" app/cache app/logs
        $ sudo chmod +a "`whoami` allow delete,write,append,file_inherit,directory_inherit" app/cache app/logs


    **2. Using ACL on a system that does not support chmod +a**

    Some systems don't support ``chmod +a``, but do support another utility
    called ``setfacl``. You may need to `enable ACL support`_ on your partition
    and install setfacl before using it (as is the case with Ubuntu). This
    uses a command to try to determine your web server user and set it as
    ``HTTPDUSER``:

    .. code-block:: bash

		$ HTTPDUSER=`ps aux | grep -E '[a]pache|[h]ttpd|[_]www|[w]ww-data|[n]ginx' | grep -v root | head -1 | cut -d\  -f1`
		$ sudo setfacl -R -m u:"$HTTPDUSER":rwX -m u:`whoami`:rwX app/cache app/logs
		$ sudo setfacl -dR -m u:"$HTTPDUSER":rwX -m u:`whoami`:rwX app/cache app/logs

    If this doesn't work, try adding ``-n`` option.

    **3. Without using ACL**

    If you don't have access to changing the ACL of the directories, you will
    need to change the umask so that the cache and log directories will
    be group-writable or world-writable (depending if the web server user
    and the command line user are in the same group or not). To achieve
    this, put the following line at the beginning of the ``app/console``,
    ``web/app.php`` and ``web/app_dev.php`` files::

        umask(0002); // This will let the permissions be 0775

        // or

        umask(0000); // This will let the permissions be 0777

    Note that using the ACL is recommended when you have access to them
    on your server because changing the umask is not thread-safe.

    **4. Use the built-in web server in development environments**

    The built-in PHP web server - which can be used during development - allows
    your web server user and CLI user to be the same. This removes any permissions
    issues:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ php app/console server:start

    .. seealso::

        Read more about the internal server :doc:`in the cookbook </cookbook/web_server/built_in>`.

    **5. Use the same user for the CLI and the web server**

    In development environments, it is a common practice to use the same unix
    user for the CLI and the web server because it avoids any of these permissions
    issues when setting up new projects. This can be done by editing your web server
    configuration (e.g. commonly httpd.conf or apache2.conf for Apache) and setting
    its user to be the same as your CLI user (e.g. for Apache, update the User
    and Group values).

When everything is fine, click on "Go to the Welcome page" to request your
first "real" Symfony webpage:

.. code-block:: text

    http://localhost/app_dev.php/

Symfony should welcome and congratulate you for your hard work so far!

.. image:: /images/quick_tour/welcome.png

.. tip::

    To get nice and short urls you should point the document root of your
    webserver or virtual host to the ``Symfony/web/`` directory. Though
    this is not required for development it is recommended at the time your
    application goes into production as all system and configuration files
    become inaccessible to clients then. For information on configuring
    your specific web server document root, read
    :doc:`/cookbook/configuration/web_server_configuration`
    or consult the official documentation of your webserver:
    `Apache`_ | `Nginx`_ .

Beginning Development
---------------------

Now that you have a fully-functional Symfony application, you can begin
development! Your distribution may contain some sample code - check the
``README.md`` file included with the distribution (open it as a text file)
to learn about what sample code was included with your distribution.

If you're new to Symfony, check out ":doc:`page_creation`", where you'll
learn how to create pages, change configuration, and do everything else you'll
need in your new application.

Be sure to also check out the :doc:`Cookbook </cookbook/index>`, which contains
a wide variety of articles about solving specific problems with Symfony.

.. note::

    If you want to remove the sample code from your distribution, take a look
    at this cookbook article: ":doc:`/cookbook/bundles/remove`"

Using Source Control
--------------------

If you're using a version control system like ``Git`` or ``Subversion``, you
can setup your version control system and begin committing your project to
it as normal. The Symfony Standard Edition *is* the starting point for your
new project.

For specific instructions on how best to setup your project to be stored
in Git, see :doc:`/cookbook/workflow/new_project_git`.

Ignoring the ``vendor/`` Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you've downloaded the archive *without vendors*, you can safely ignore
the entire ``vendor/`` directory and not commit it to source control. With
``Git``, this is done by creating and adding the following to a ``.gitignore``
file:

.. code-block:: text

    /vendor/

Now, the vendor directory won't be committed to source control. This is fine
(actually, it's great!) because when someone else clones or checks out the
project, they can simply run the ``php composer.phar install`` script to
install all the necessary project dependencies.
